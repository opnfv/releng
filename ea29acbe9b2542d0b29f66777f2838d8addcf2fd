      "message": "ok, i think i start to understand this better: in ODL we have 1 jenkins job per perf test but since in OPNFV takes longer to deploy test environment, we are aiming for a single jenkins job to run a list of perf tests that depending on the total duration could be smoke/daily/weekly fashion, right?\n\nI have another question: if we decided it is better to have separated jenkins jobs per tests (openflow, ovsdb, netconf, etc), would it be possible to trigger the different jobs from the top level installer job?",

      "message": "It is possible to trigger different jobs from top level installer job but then we will need to handle triggers for cperf differently comparing to the rest of the test projects as they have 1 job. (having 1 job to run everything is not good since you reduce the granularity of the feedback and time it takes to get feedback increases so what you ask is pretty valid.)\n\nWe need to think about how to fix this so I suggest you to continue with basic job structure and we improve it later on if that\u0027s fine by you.\n\nPs. There are quite few things to think about how to fix all this job structuring. Increase in no of scenarios, pods, installers, test projects have potential to make things challenging.",

But another job on the same level and coming before cperf job which is the deploy job.\n\nScenario name is passed by the upstream job from downstream jobs in case if the test projects select which test cases to run based on the scenario. For example if the scenario is odl they skip running onos test cases against an onos scenario.\n\nWhen I said running manually which means there might be times you want to do  cperf troubleshooting/development or work with the deployment. In these situations you can skip running deployment job and use the POD in previously deployed state to focus actual problem in the hand. This is the first reason why this parameter is here. 2nd reason is about a limitation with Jenkins Parameterized Build Trigger; if passed parameter is not defined in downstream job, that parameter can not be passed.\n\n\nBUT and this BUT is important.\nEverything explained above is followed by 3 of the installers; compass, fuel and joid.\nApex does things in entirely different and non-standard way. They do not follow the rest of the OPNFV. You either have to make sure Apex is aligned with the rest or you have to work closely with Tim and Dan and do things in non-standard way.",

      "message": "We do this for other test projects in same way; everything gets put into docker images and run from there.\n\nThere are couple of reasons why I think you should go pure docker way and skip installing stuff on jumphosts if cperf has no technical reasons for not doing so.\n\nWhy this is important and apologies for pointing the obvious and same things over and over; \n\n- we keep the need to deal with jumphosts and put less requirements on it. For test projects tooling, we only require installation of docker and that\u0027s it.\n- we refrain from installing stuff to jumphosts as there are many things needed by different projects and these things might conflict with each other.\n- installing this type of tools creates a mess on the jumphost as we do not have a practice to clean after our job is done. \n- having local installation of the tools on jumphost limits the portability of the jobs/test projects since you have to install those same tools again and again if you want to run on a different jumphost against different POD. Or if the jumphost gets replaced which happens time to time. Or someone accidentally executes yum remove/apt-get remove \u003ccperf tool\u003e on jumphost.\n- we currently have no way to install these dependencies/tools on jumphost automatically - we have plans but those plans might not be realized due to lack of time and hands.\n- this eases the OPNFV users to use different test frameworks without wasting their time to install 10s of different tools on their machines if their only reason to use test frameworks is for running tests. Pull image, run the container and that\u0027s all.\n\nlong story short this is partly in your hands. Our suggestion is to totally dockerize if there are no technical reasons preventing this. If you go to local installation, things would work fine on dedicated jumphost/pod but later on/over time things might get tricky when you want to move around.",

      "message": "So my point is not to install test SW directly in the jump host but internally in another host in the POD using docker if possible. The reason is perf/scale tools can consume lots of CPU/RAM so we may not want to run them in the same shared resource as controller or even robot test control. But maybe this is not the way in OPNFV and tools even when they consume lot of resources are installed in jump host.",
