(doctor and test fw verifications) Apart from this, it would be good if we can explicitly state the snapshots are promoted on a daily basis. So my suggestion for the name would be\n\n  apex-promote-daily-{stream}",

Then in the CSIT job it would just download whatever is in that folder if the md5 mismatches.  If we want to keep a history of snapshots, then I think your approach is better and more consistent with how we provide artifacts today.",
