      "message": "It supposed to work like that, but currently it is not implemented so these MACs are not used.\nI noticed that once vnic template was first assigned to interface MAC was changed, but following reasignment of template does not change MAC of control interfaces. So now you don\u0027t need to modify Foreman/Quickstack inventory file. I can remove list of MAC addreses from this yaml to avoid confusion.",
