      "message": "Only netvirt-patch-test-current-carbon create a downloadable artifact. That is the reason we put our self behind this job to not create the artifact by our own. And only if that is success it actually created the artifact. However netvirt is quite unstable for that. So the job is manly not run. We will then in the first approach create our own artifact. That should be the first thing what is then switched back.",
