      "message": "That\u0027s exactly what we will do. The wording might be improved.\n\nNikolas\u0027s idea is to have a clean Apex deployment on vPOD in standby mode so we do not spend time with Apex installation. When a netvirt patch comes in, there will be an available/clean OpenStack installation waiting so we directly start ODL stuff on it. Once the tests are completed successfully, we will wipe the vPOD and start a new Apex deployment for the upcoming patch.\n\nThis requires some thinking/trial/error on Jenkins side so details are not known as of yet.",

      "message": "I think there may be a subtle difference in what we are saying.  With what we are doing in Apex, there will be no need to deploy at all.  We are saving the post-deployed qcow2 images.  So all that needs to be done on job trigger, is replace ODL with the gerrit build on the controller qcow2, bring up the VMs (already deployed), and start tests.  At the end of the test simply delete those VMs, and repeat on the next job trigger.  The whole process of bringing up the nodes will take only a few minutes.",
