      "message": "we could do as you say, but still TARGET_LAB and TARGET_POD won\u0027t be magically defined just because of that.\n\nThese variables are reported to deploy.sh through -l and -p, we just don\u0027t read them in armband/ci/deploy.sh, which is where we will fix this. It\u0027s just that I don\u0027t want to wait for a new ISO build to test the deployment. And this is why the commit message says \"temporarily\".",
