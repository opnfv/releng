      "message": "One thing to consider is if you are creating multiple adapters which require the same base methods to be created, you may want to use a adapter class which the specific adapter classes can inherit from.  Also that class, (or this one if there is not much functional capability to warrant a common class) should  inherit Abstract Base Class, which will ensure required methods for InstallerAdapter exist.",
