      "message": "I don\u0027t think we want to use this scenario name or RC path.  Per scenario, there is no odl_l2 anymore due to new netvirt requiring L3.  Also, we are not really testing bgpvpn here.  I think as I posted in my other patch the name of \"os-odl_l3-csit-noha\" makes the most sense.  That way in functest they can switch on the csit feature and only run those robot tests.\n\nFor the RC path, you can reference where I am unpacking the snapshot artifacts in theo ther patch.  Long term we want to make this directory dynamic to the job number so that we can have multiple runs on the same slave in parallel.",
