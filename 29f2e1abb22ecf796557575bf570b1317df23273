      "message": "vspref CI is run on bare metal, i.e. there isn\u0027t any real OPNFV platform deployment via any of listed installers at our CI server POD12-node3; To report something, vsperf hardcodes \"fuel\" for all results (I suppose that reason is, that fuel was the only installer who at least cloned vsperf repo at OPNFV installation).\n\nSo my question is - should we keep links to status of all installers here or it will cause errors when they will be clicked upon?",
