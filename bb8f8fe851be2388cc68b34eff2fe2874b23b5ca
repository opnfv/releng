It\n- gets triggered via the completion of netvirt-patch-test-current job or via the keyword opnfv-test\n- downloads netvirt artifact\n- installs netvirt on apex\n- runs functest\n- (will) upload logs to odl logserver\n\nWe are waiting for the completion of your work to promote apex snapshots and bringing up apex environment using them. So can you instead update the existing job odl-netvirt-verify-virtual-master and fix\n- downloading apex snapshots\n- bringing up apex vms using snapshots\n- and the rest\nin it?",

      "message": "Yeah this is a duplicate of the other job.  It was intentional because I was only doing this temporarily to make debugging the snapshot deploy easier and then I was going to migrate to the 3rd party job.  The reason it is easier is because I already have VPN access to our verify slaves, and I had changed the trigger to trigger on a comment, so I could control when the job would deploy and then debug it.  I don\u0027t mind modifying the 3rd part job directly.  If I go that route, can I get VPN access to the slaves and do you mind if I temporarily change the trigger to trigger on \"check opfnv experimental\"?",
