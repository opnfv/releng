If we change it into /var/tmp/opnfv-securedlab like this, then there will be no Daisy4NFV project code any more, then results in line 29 failed.\n\nSorry maybe I missed some email thread due to my sick leave. What is the reason we need to remove securelab\u0027s code out of $WORKSPACE? If we need to, maybe we need another parameter to pass it to ./ci/deploy/deploy.sh at line 29.",
