      "message": "the scenario info is extracted by the upstream job xci-verify-{distro}-{type}-{stream} which then get used by the downstream jobs to set the scenario to deploy and test. if we use $WORKSPACE of the parent job we probably need to hardcode that into scripts like how we are doing with /tmp directory.\n\nso it is not straightforward to get the relation between upstream and downstream jobs; who triggered me info. if you look at the env vars of deploy job, you will see the upstream job is not listed there.\n\nhttps://build.opnfv.org/ci/job/xci-verify-ubuntu-deploy-virtual-master/731/injectedEnvVars/\n\nif we ever change the job names, everything will be impacted due to hardcoded upstream job name.\n\nbut common things across the jobs are GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER and the /tmp directory.",
