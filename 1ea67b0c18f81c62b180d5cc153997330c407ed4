      "message": "We could perhaps use a macro for triggers instead of setting polling to the same time both for master and stable-arno daily jobs. Jenkins will try to trigger both daily jobs around the same time, causing one of them to wait in the queue for 3,5 hours. Perhaps more important issue is that this doesn\u0027t give us any timewindow to troubleshoot the pod if/when things go wrong since the queued job will directly start once the previous job execution ends wiping out the problematic state from the pod.\n\nIf you need, you can take a look at bottom of https://etherpad.opnfv.org/p/octopusR2 to see an example of trigger macro there.",
