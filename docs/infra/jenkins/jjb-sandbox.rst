Abstract:
=========

This document is temporary, eventually we will have a document that covers all LFN projects.

The jenkins-sandbox instanceâ€™s purpose is to allow projects to test their JJB setups before merging their code into the releng repository. It is configured similarly to the master instance, although it cannot publish artifacts or vote in Gerrit.

Uploading a job to sandbox.opnfv.org
------------------------------------

Get JJB:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder
   cd jenkins-job-builder/
   virtualenv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r test-requirements.txt -e .
   $ jenkins-jobs --version
   Jenkins Job Builder version: 2.0.6

#note you should edit test-requirements.txt and downgrade to version 2.0.3

create a jenkins.ini (later referenced as --conf ~/jenkins_jobs.ini)

.. code-block:: bash

   [jenkins]
   user=lfid
   password=password
   url=https://sandbox.opnfv.org

Modify a job
------------

In this example I have added a job in jjb/releng/opnfv-utils.yml called new-job I am including the required defaults with

.. code-block:: bash

   jjb/global/releng-macros.yml:jjb/global/releng-defaults.yml


  and the file that contains the modifed job at the end with

.. code-block:: bash

   :jjb/releng/opnfv-utils.yml

Only push one job at a time please, this means you must include the final parameter (job name)
job names that are parameterized must be expaneded eg: job-{branch) must become job-master

test:

.. code-block:: bash

   (.venv)x $ jenkins-jobs --conf ~/jenkins_jobs.ini test \
   -r jjb/global/releng-macros.yml:jjb/global/releng-defaults.yml:jjb/releng/opnfv-utils.yml new-job

deploy:

.. code-block:: bash

   (.venv)$ jenkins-jobs --conf ~/jenkins_jobs.ini update \
   -r jjb/global/releng-macros.yml:jjb/global/releng-defaults.yml:jjb/releng/opnfv-utils.yml new-job
