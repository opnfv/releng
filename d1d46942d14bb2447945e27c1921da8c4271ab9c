      "message": "the scenario is usually a combination [bare metal | virt] - [ odl, onos, opencontrail, nosdn ] - [specific stuff], will the SDN controller not included in DEPLOY SCENARIO at the end?\nand getting 2 param for the same thing could lead to mismatch\n\nSCENARIO_DEPLOY \u003d A.1 \nSDN_CONTROLLER \u003d nosdn\n\n...\nthe risk is limited but would it make sense to remove SDN_CONTROLLER if it is captured in the SCENARIO?",

      "message": "That\u0027s the idea Morgan.\n\nI\u0027m hoping one of the installer teams come up with scenario naming/description so in the end we will hopefully get rid of the controller name and all the scenario details are kept in DEPLOY_SCENARIO name/file or whatever.\n\nWhat I imagine having is a scenario name like odl_sfc, onos, etc. which will then be translated to corresponding scenario description file and the details are parsed out from the file.\n\nThe SDN_CONTROLLER is the interim solution for us to get Arno and controller based scenario work proceed until installers finish their work.",
