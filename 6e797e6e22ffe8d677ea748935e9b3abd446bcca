What we will do for other parameters, will we keep changing job names?\n\nYou can perhaps introduce a choice parameter COMPASS_OS_VERSION to main job and set one of the OSes compass supports as default and add the other one as the other choice. \n\nOR\n\nYou can perhaps add this to scenario instead of introducing a new field in job name.\n\nThere is an optional field in scenario name, the last one, which is not used yet.\n\nhttps://wiki.opnfv.org/brahmaputra_testing_page#scenario_naming\n\nAnd the deployment scripts executed by compass-deploy-{pod}-daily-{stream} can use scenario to find out what OS is there.",
