      "message": "I am not sure if I understand correctly. Does it mean that this jobs will only be run on the intel hardware. We have dedicated hardware in the ericsson lab for this, and it is running already since 20 days on that hardware. Why do you want to change this?\n\nAlso this means that we have one deployment per node. The idea was that we have multiple deployments in one node. At the moment 6 deployments do work well already.\n\nI have the feeling I am missing information here. Did you and Fatih had an discussion which I am not aware of?",

      "message": "I have a question and accompanying concerns/suggestions regarding handling this like a scenario.\n\nFirst question is; is this really a new scenario featurewise or same as the os-odl_l3-nofeature-noha but with differences regarding how the environment is deployed, number of nodes, etc?\n\nIf the scenario is same, can we not use anything that might make people think this as different scenario? Instead, can we name the job something like \"apex-deploy-virtual-csit-noha-{stream}\" or use an environment variable to make this script aware of what it is supposed to deploy?\n\nMy concern is; if the scenario is same but we introduce a new scenario name, we will probably need to update functest since this scenario name is passed to the functest job in  odl-netvirt.yml. And it might confuse people like what happened in my case.",
