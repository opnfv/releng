So it will need to be modified to support listing from both fields.\n\n2) We don\u0027t need to login to gerrit to verify branches, we can us `git ls-remote`: https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/MOzc9Fq1MLH2T0Cws1sGqg\n\n3) `jenkins-ci` shouldn\u0027t be listed in the ssh command as the user should be specified from the ssh-agent plugin.",
