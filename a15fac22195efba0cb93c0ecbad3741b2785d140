      "message": "Hi Mark,\nIf I understood correctly, I think that L7 is meant to *create* the stable/gambia branch, starting from commit id on L9, which is the current tip of master, which looks decent.\nIf you\u0027d prefer that the *to be created* stable/gambia branch starts from tags/opnfv-7.0.stable.RC4, then the commit id on L9 should be set to 5f84c19c4511da6706a501308b509aacbc6219de.\nBut since you are on a CI/CD model, you might not wish that such a branch gets created... and your customers, such as Yardstick, would have to adapt to it and to regularly be adjusted to fetch the commit id that they deem \"stable\" enough, unless you plan to help them with regular tags. Them pinning to storperf master would possibly be too risky.\nhttps://git.opnfv.org/storperf",
