      "message": "do we need pod and pod name?\nis there any risk of inconsistency\nwhen cally the API I imagine we could call with pod or pod_name\nif we use the 2 parameters with non corresponding value, it could be a problem\n\nas far as I understand pod is an integer , arbitrary given\nthe best would be to follow Releng rules?\n\nwhen we run CI, we give the following paramters:\n- PROJECT\n- INSTALLER_TYPE\n- INSTALLER_IP (not needed)\n- GIT_BASE (not needed)\n\n\nand the job may be suffixed by the version e.g. functest-fuel-stable-arno\n\u003d\u003e give the version here stable-arno\n\nand is run on a POD which name can be defined as:\n- opnfv-jump-2\n- intel-wcp1\n- huawei-deploy1\n\n\u003d\u003e to be discussed with Releng/Fatih but I would suggest to define only pod as the pod identifier that would be a string as defined in CI (e.g. opnfv-jum-2)",
