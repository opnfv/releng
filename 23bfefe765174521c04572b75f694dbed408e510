      "message": "If I understand correctly: if there are N projects that build docker images we first build all these N images in sequence.\nAnd only if all N images succeed the second batch of functest child images are built?\nOr is it finer grain - at the level of every repo (meaning storperf and yardstick containers can be built concurrently)?\n\nWhich repos get their images rebuilt? Only those that have a changeset submitted in gerrit? On what trigger?\nJust too many questions maybe we need a short document that describes how all this works (gerrit not best format).\nWe need to document clearly:\n- how builds are trigerred\n- in what order/sequence/concurrency\n\nAs of today it looks like the builds are triggered periodically (even when there is no change in repo) on an unknown period (looks like once or twice a day).\n\nAlso would be nice to mention how to trigger a container build based on tag (got a piece of it in another review but missing the other half).",
