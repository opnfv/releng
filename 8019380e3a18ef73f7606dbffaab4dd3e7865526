Then we can avoid a new trigger to perform building and testing. It will also save much time and many resources.\n\nthis line is used for this?\nexclude-no-code-change: \u0027true\u0027",

      "message": "Yep, that\u0027s good but not in this case cause commit message check is something we will need to do in order to see if it contains the patterns we agreed.\n\nIf you think this scenario; I send a change to Gerrit but forget to include which scenario that change impacts. The patch verification fails since it misses the scenario name. I notice this, update the commit message and include the scenario name in commit message this time without touching any file. In this case, the job will not be triggered, causing change not to be verified by Jenkins job.",
