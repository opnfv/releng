      "message": "this makes me think some more as the options here will be\n\n    master-master\n    master-colorado\n\nwhich might not be that clear either.\n\nI think the stream handling in previous patch is more cleaner and less confusing comparing to this one; \"we test master and colorado versions of OPNFV using dovetail from its master\"\n\nIf you don\u0027t object, I suggest using the previous stream handling even the concerns are still there. We will need to revisit this later on since this is the first case we do not match platform version against the test fw version and need to think or wait and see what dovetail will do coming months.",
