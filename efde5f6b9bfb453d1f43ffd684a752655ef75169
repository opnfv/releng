      "message": "not sure if this part is right.  From what I read multi jobs in the same phase execute simultaneously as long as there are enough executors.  My plan was to limit executors here so only 1 would run at a time.  The reason I put them all in the same phase was I thought that way I could render all of the scenarios in order.  I wasn\u0027t sure if breaking up into separate phases would render all the jobs for each scenario in the right order, like DEPLOY(scenario1)-\u003eFUNCTEST(scenario1)-\u003eYARDSTICK(scenario1), or if it would end up being DEPLOY (scenario1)-\u003eDEPLOY(scenario2)...DEPLOY(scenariox)-\u003eFunctest(scenario1).",
