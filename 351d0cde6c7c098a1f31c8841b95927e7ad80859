      "message": "possibly but whatever is installed in .xci-deploy-env is meant to be just repositories etc. VMs, services etc are being installed on real root. correct? These are just artifacts for the xci-deploy.sh script. I personally wouldn\u0027t like the script to just pollute my $HOME directory like this. And there is already a facility to use local repositories by using the \u0027*_DEV_PATH\u0027 variables. Either way I am happy to change that.\n\nBut that\u0027s my personally opinion I am happy to change it to something else.",

      "message": "Now I remembered that the reason I didn\u0027t pick $HOME was because when you deploy remote hosts, $HOME still points to your home directory so on the remote host you end up having a /home/$youruser/ directory even though there is no such user on that host. So I picked a directory that everybody can writes to and you know it exists on every host.",
