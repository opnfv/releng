      "message": "ok, so clearly we need to get out of this apex-daily job with our cperf trigger builds block.  we have intel pod2 dedicated to cperf, so we should be using it, and I missed the fact that\nwe were putting an ODL job right after an ONOS job.\n\nthat was my confusion.  Where/How are we telling our deployer (apex in this case) to go do it\u0027s thing on intel pod2 then trigger our cperf job?\n\ndo we need to create an whole new apex job to do this?  that\u0027s what I\u0027m starting to think, and it would be something\nlike what you have in your stream listsings (stream, stream1, stream2) at the top of this file.  But, I also remember that \nI was using stream2 wrong before.",
